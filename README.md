# C# Catalog

C# Catalog is an app made for the final lesson of MaxiPrograma's third-level course on .Net/C#. This app serves as an online catalog administrator for managing an e-commerce platform.

## MaxiPrograma's course
The goal of the final lesson of the course, is the creation of an app with basic functions for the management of a store catalog. Additionally, users can create accounts, browse products, and add items to their favorites section.

## Implementation of the virtual store
After to pass the course, I was inspired by my instructor  to create the e-commerce section, so I added a cart function, and its validations. Also the users can review their purchases with detailed information and dates.

## Technologies

* .Net Framework 4.8
* Bootstrap 5
* Font Awesome 4

## Features

* Create, read, update and delete articles/products in database.
* Creation and validation of users, in a login-screen.
* Validations for database interactions.
* Different filter-fields.

### Cart functions:
* Add products to the cart.
* Modify the quantity of a product.
* Empty the cart.

## Instalation
You can clone this repository with the next command:
```
git clone https://github.com/tu-usuario/tu-repositorio.git
```
### Database setup
Before of the app execution, you should have a database configured. You can use a local database like MySql or Microsoft SQL Sever.
(if you are using SQL Server, you can use the script inside of the repository, in the folder "dbscript").

## Access the applicaton
Once you have installed the database, you can start your browser and navigate to the URL provided in the output terminal (for example: "http://localhost::port").
